## Concepts

The following libraries are used to implement API in Orochi: 

- Django REST framework: a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- DRF - Yet another Swagger generator 2: Automated generation of real Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 schemas from Django REST Framework code.
- drf-nested-routers: this package provides routers and fields to create nested resources in the Django Rest Framework. Nested resources are needed for full REST URL structure, if one resource lives inside another.

## ReDoc

ReDoc is an open-source tool that generates API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. Itâ€™s one of the most powerful free docs tools in the industry, producing clean, customizable documentation with an attractive three-panel design.

## Browsable API

API may stand for Application Programming Interface, but humans have to be able to read the APIs, too; someone has to do the programming. Django REST Framework supports generating human-friendly HTML output for each resource when the HTML format is requested. These pages allow for easy browsing of resources, as well as forms for submitting data to the resources using POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Runserver and check product list and product detail endpoints. You should see similar pages.
