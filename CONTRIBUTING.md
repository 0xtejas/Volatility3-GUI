# Contributing guidelines

## Pull Request Checklist

Before sending your pull requests, make sure you followed this list.

- Read [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Read [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


### How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

- If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

#### Community
